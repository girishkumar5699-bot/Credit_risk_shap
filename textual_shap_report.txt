Global SHAP summary — top 5 features and interpretation:
1. num__num_open_accounts: mean(|SHAP|)=0.6808 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
2. num__employment_length_years: mean(|SHAP|)=0.5144 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
3. num__loan_term_months: mean(|SHAP|)=0.3806 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
4. num__age: mean(|SHAP|)=0.2179 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
5. num__income: mean(|SHAP|)=0.1711 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.

Local case studies (plain-language):

Case: true_positive (test index 10)
Model predicted probability of default = 0.669; predicted label = 1; true label = 1
Top drivers:
 - num__debt_to_income => increases probability by SHAP 2.9623
 - num__employment_length_years => decreases probability by SHAP -0.7477
 - num__age => decreases probability by SHAP -0.7037
 - num__loan_term_months => decreases probability by SHAP -0.3531
 - num__loan_amount => decreases probability by SHAP -0.2003
 - num__income => decreases probability by SHAP -0.1990
 - cat__home_ownership_RENT => decreases probability by SHAP -0.0692
 - cat__home_ownership_MORTGAGE => increases probability by SHAP 0.0660
